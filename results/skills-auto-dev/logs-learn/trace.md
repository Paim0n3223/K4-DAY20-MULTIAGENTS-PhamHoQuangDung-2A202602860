### Human
Parse the log file `workspace/app.log` (see `workspace/README.md` for the format).

Write a file `workspace/errors.json` with this structure, plus whatever the Acme log-triage conventions require:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {"timestamp_utc": "2024-05-01T03:04:05Z", "service": "payment-service", "level": "ERROR",
     "message": "Charge failed order=991", "exception": "ValueError: invalid card number", "repeat_count": 1}
  ],
  "counts_by_service": {"payment-service": 1}
}
```

Rules:
- Include only entries whose level is ERROR or CRITICAL (any capitalisation). Do not include WARN/WARNING/INFO/DEBUG entries.
- `timestamp_utc` is the entry time converted to UTC, formatted `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
- `level` is written in upper case. `message` is the text after `<service>: ` on the first line of the entry.
- `exception` is the last line of the traceback attached to the entry, or `null` if the entry has no traceback.
- `repeat_count` is 1 plus the sum of N from the `-- last message repeated N times --` lines that follow the entry (after its extra lines, if any).
- `counts_by_service` is the sum of `repeat_count` per service.

Your output file is also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme log-triage conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you parsed the file.

description: Use when parsing unstructured logs or text streams into structured JSON outputs with strict sorting and schema requirements.

1. Review output schema specifications carefully to include all mandated top-level keys, version numbers, and metadata identifiers.
2. Normalize entity identifiers and service names according to domain formatting rules (e.g., lowercasing and replacing hyphens with underscores).
3. Sort output lists and nested records using multi-level sorting keys (e.g., primary service name, secondary UTC timestamp) in ascending order.
4. Validate generated JSON structures against target schemas before finishing tasks.

# app.log - format

Each log entry starts with a line:

    <timestamp> [<LEVEL>] <service>: <message>

- `timestamp` is ISO-8601 with a UTC offset (`+07:00`, `-05:00` or `Z`).
- Levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN/WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL. Level names are not always written in upper case.
- An entry can be followed by extra lines (for example a Python traceback). Those lines belong to the entry above them.
- A line `-- last message repeated N times --` means the entry above it (together with its extra lines) occurred N more times.
