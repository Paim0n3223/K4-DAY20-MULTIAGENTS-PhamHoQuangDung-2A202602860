1. Inspect all package docstrings and requirements to identify strict constraints on function signatures, formatting, rounding rules, and case sensitivity.
2. Ensure every public function (not starting with `_`) has complete type annotations for all parameters and return values.
3. Add regression tests (e.g., in a dedicated test file) covering every bug fixed or edge case specified, ensuring the test suite passes cleanly.
4. Record all fixes in `CHANGELOG.md` under a `## Unreleased` heading using standard bullet formats (e.g., `- fix(<function>): <description>`).
